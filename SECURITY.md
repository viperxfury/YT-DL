## Supported Versions

Currently all work on this project goes into the nightly builds.
4.2's RELEASE build is now quite old and should be considered legacy.
We urge users to use the nightly releases, because the project
constantly sees fixes.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please file an issue in our GitHub's repo, because this app
isn't meant to be safe to run as public instance yet, but rather as a LAN facing app.

We welcome PRs and help in general in making YTDL-M more secure, but it's not a priority as of now.
